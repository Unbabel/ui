The goal of this component is to behave as closely as possible to the native [`<select>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select).

It includes some elements such as labels to enable consistent comunication across forms.

It also enables choosing a `placeholder`. Choosing a placeholder adds a disabled option with the text provided.
