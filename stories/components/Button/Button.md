This component works like a classic `<button>` element but can also be used as an `<a>` element.

To use this component as an `<a>` element you must provide the `href` prop.

Besides its default state, it has 3 visual variations (`kind` prop) and 2 size variations (`size` prop).

There is also an extra CSS class `is-smaller-when-clicked` that makes the button a bit smaller when it's being clicked.

It can also be disabled using the `disabled` prop.

You can bind any standard event to this component. In the example below you can see we are handling any clicks on the component.
