The simplest Modal shows a message and a button for user acknowledgement.

It also supports longer texts that trigger scrollbars, having a close button on the corner and having a form inside. You can put whatever elements you want on the bottom. By default it has the least destructive option selected (in this examples' case, the Cancel button)
