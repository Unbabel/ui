### Description
Briefly explain WHAT do we need to change.
> Eg. Change the text of the “demote info” on the dashboard, so that the user know that he is no longer a paid editor.

### Why?
Enumerate reasons to change.
Stress how important this improvement is.
> Eg. Users keep asking why they are not able to get paid tasks anymore, so we need a clearer way to let them know that they are not paid editors due to bad evaluations.

### Current Status:
Describe step by step the current situation.
> Eg.

> 1 – Login in the application

> 2 – On the Dashboard, the note informing that the user had a bad evaluation is not clear: “You had a poor evaluation score, sorry”

### Desired Status:
Describe step by step what would be the ideal outcome.
> Eg.

> 1 – Login in the application

> 2 – On the Dashboard, the note informing that the user had a bad evaluation must be clear: “You were demoted to trainee, so you can’t access paid tasks, sorry”

### Additional Information:
> Add other relevant information that would be useful to analyse the improvement.
