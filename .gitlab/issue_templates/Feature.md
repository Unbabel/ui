### Why?
Very briefly, why would anyone use this?
> Eg. Community manager do not have metrics of how the community growth.

### Description
Describe the problem, specify what would be the benefits

> Eg. After an automatic promotion/demotion, the editor will end up in either paid editors list or trainee list and we lost the track of which users were promoted and which were demoted.

### Scenarios
Use as many stories as necessary to define how this would work in different scenario variations, how people would use this and how this could affect the system.  
Something like: When _, I want to _, So I can _

> Eg.

> 1- When I go to the trainees view, I want to see how many trainees were demoted from paid editors, so I can track the editors and trainee growth variation.

> 2- When I go to the trainees view, I want to see when a trainees was demoted from paid editors, so I can track the editors and trainee growth variation on a determined period.

> 3 - When I go to the paid editors view, I want to see how many paid editors were promoted from trainees, so I can track the editors and trainee growth variation.

> ...

### Plan
Convey your plan to tackle this. Tell people how this could be achieved.
> Eg. We could add new a new column “promoted on” on the paid editors view and a new column “demoted on” on the trainee view that we can order and have the number of how many were promoted/demoted and when.

### Links / references
Always back up your proposals, try to include links, references, etc.
> Eg. Similar as how we check if users were active by sorting the column “Last Task Done”.
