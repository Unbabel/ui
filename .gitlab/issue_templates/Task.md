### Why?
Very briefly, why we need to do this task?
> E.g. The content type from Pinterest is just tags and terms. It is not a good content for evaluation so the evaluation result won't show the real quality of the editors.

### Description
Specify what information do the assignee need to start the task
Use verbs to describe what we need to do and what should be the final product of those actions.
> E.g. Please filter out the tasks from customerXYZ so we donâ€™t send the tasks from this account to evaluation. We also thought about to asking the evaluators to skip the evaluation tasks from Pinterest, but since we have 12k tasks from Pinterest, it is not a solution.

### Start Criteria
Specify the preconditions and precedent tasks we must satisfy in order to start this task.
Usually tasks are dependent on other tasks to finish, so we should specify when are we able to start doing the task.
> Eg. 1. The customer account for customerXYZ is created

> If this is not applicable set it as N/A

### Completion Criteria
If the task is composed of a set of activities we have to perform, write a checklist of the result of the activities we must perform
> Eg.

> [] Remove all the current evaluation tasks from customerXYZ.

> [] Stop creating evaluations tasks from customerXYZ.
